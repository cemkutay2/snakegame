Local 2 player snake game to play with a friend, very cool!

## Main Gameplay
Just like the classic snake game, you can eat food to get bigger. 2 random food spawn at random locations at start. Eating one makes it spawn at a random location again. Collapsing with yourself or the other snake makes you respawn at the starting position with your starting length. Currently there is no end goal.
## Current Features
- **Local Multiplayer**

Use WASD (yellow snake) and arrow keys (green snake) to control your snakes!

- **Switching States**

Collapsing with the other snake causes you to switch states! Change color and become invulnerable for 2 seconds. *You do **not** switch states if you collapse with yourself.*
> Yellow turns into a white-ish color. Green turns into a light blue-ish color.

- **Wall TP**

Run into a wall to appear on the other side!
>  I am not sure if I should keep this but it is fun for now at least.

- **SFX**

Honestly, they are not special at all. But i made them so it is cool :D.

### Features I am planning to add
- **An Actual End Goal**
- **Online Multiplayer** (Only on LAN first)
- **Complete UI**
